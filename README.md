🚀 About This Repository
Welcome to my AI Agent Odyssey! This repository is a living document of my journey into the fascinating world of autonomous AI agents. Here, I'll be sharing my projects, code snippets, notes, and insights as I explore powerful frameworks and platforms like LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, n8n, and LangSmith. The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of how to design, build, and deploy intelligent agents that can perform complex tasks.

🛠️ Technologies Explored
This repository will cover a range of tools and technologies. Here's a quick overview:

LangChain: An open-source framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides the building blocks for creating complex chains of logic.

LangGraph: A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It's perfect for creating cyclical and more complex agent behaviors.

CrewAI: A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. It helps in creating collaborative agents that can work together to solve problems.

n8n: A workflow automation tool that allows for easy integration of various services, including AI models, to create powerful, automated workflows.

LangSmith: A platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM applications. It's an essential tool for ensuring the reliability of AI agents.

📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized to make it easy to follow my learning path.

└── README.md                # You are here!

🏁 Getting Started
To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need to have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook (for some of the examples)

An OpenAI API key (or another LLM provider's key)

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent-Odyssey.git
cd AI-Agent-Odyssey

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: A requirements.txt file should be added as you start your projects.)

💡 Usage
Each project folder contains its own README.md with specific instructions on how to run the code. Generally, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks to see the code in action or run the Python scripts from the command line.

For example, to run a LangChain project:

cd langchain-projects/my-first-agent
python agent.py

🧠 My Learnings
